# COSC1336, Lab 5, part 1: Rewrite launch sequence software with functions
#
# Launch a rocket into space.
#
# This program mostly works. It executes the steps required to launch a
# rocket into space. You will improve the program. The output will be the
# same after modification.

# BIG PROBLEM!!! It is written without any functions. It has lots and lots
# of redundant code. Identify common blocks of redundant code. Gather the
# redundant code into functions. Eliminate all unneeded extra code.
# Use parameters if useful. Call your functions from launch(). 

# Arrange your program so all output starts and ends in launch().
# See program 3-3 on pages 93, 94 (2ed), program 5-3 on pages 177, 178 (3ed),
# pages 221, 222 (4ed) to see an example of how your program
# can be organized into multiple functions.
#
# When this part is done and tested, copy / paste the code into the
# menu-driven loop shell program. This part will become the 1)launch option.
