# Name: T. Emerson Copeland  MW19
# COSC1336, Lab 1, Fix print syntax errors
#
# An easy first program prints out a few words, like: Hello, world!
# But when learning a brand new language, even something
# "easy" can be difficult. Find and fix any errors below.
#
# There should be a space between words in your output.
# Each statement displays some text.
# Repair each output instruction so it outputs correctly.
# Statements can be repaired with the proper use of the print function
# and the proper use of string deliminators.
# IF IT IS NOT BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT.
# Make fixes only if needed with the least amount of editing possible.
